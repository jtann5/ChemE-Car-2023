# ChemE-Car-2023

This project includes the code necessary to operate the 2023 MSU ChemE Car.

BCM - Body Control Module 
Operates the controls for the soleniod and the motors.

ECU - Electronic Control Unit
Operates the functions of the GUI, and the total operations of the car. Also controls the luminol reaction with the sensor that determines the luminesense of the chemical reaction. 

The BCM is a secondary arduino that communicates with the primary arduino ECU.

All Team Members who contributed to car:
